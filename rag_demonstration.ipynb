    "## What is RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** is a technique that enhances LLM responses by retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge base before generating an answer. Instead of relying solely on the LLM's training data, RAG allows the model to access current, domain-specific information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why RAG?**\n",
    "- LLMs have knowledge cutoff dates and don't know about recent information\n",
    "- LLMs don't know about your private/company data\n",
    "- RAG grounds responses in actual documents, reducing hallucinations\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates RAG using **LangChain v1+ with LCEL** (LangChain Expression Language).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Technologies:**\n",
    "- **LangChain**: Framework for building LLM applications\n",
    "- **LCEL**: Modern way to compose LangChain components as chains\n",
    "- **sentence-transformers**: Converts text to vector embeddings\n",
    "- **Qdrant**: Vector database for similarity search\n",
    "- **LangGraph**: Orchestrates complex multi-step workflows\n",
    "- **Ollama**: Runs LLMs locally (we'll use Gemma2 2B)\n",
